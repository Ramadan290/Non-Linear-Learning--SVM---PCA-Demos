# üß† Non-Linear Learning: SVM & PCA Demos

This repository demonstrates two powerful techniques in machine learning when dealing with **non-linearly separable data**:

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Both are applied to real-world datasets using scikit-learn and visualized to support concept understanding.
